OSMeF
=====

The OpenStack Measurement Framework is used to measure the impact of virtualization in a
number of different scenarios, mostly centered around the traffic patterns generated by
Hadoop applications.

Right now OSMeF covers only networking end-to-end I/O and a couple of special cases to
measure the raw hypervisor vitual NIC performance. We plan to extend OSMeF to cover also
more complex communication patterns like one-to-many, many-to-many and many-to-one. Disk I/O
will be another focus where OSMeF can be used.

Quick start
-----------
OSMeF is run by using one of the scripts in the scenarios/ directory. Their name should be
self explanatory, but more documentation will follow this first release.

Some of the scenarios require a password-less ssh key to be provided, you need to modify
config.ini and the scenario script to provide to correct details.

Also IP addresses need to be appropriately configured in the scenario script.

Finally you need to fill-in the template_login file with the authentication details of
the OpenStack's tenant you want to use for running the experiments.

Output data
-----------
By default measurements will be saved in json format in the output/results directory.
A number of script in the data_processing directory help with examining the data,
summarizing it and drawing graphs.

Python versions
---------------
OSMeF itself runs with Python 2.7. The ssh library spur, that is not compatible with
PYthon 3, is required and can be installed with the script in the deps/ directory.

The data_processing tools instead require Python 3.3.

The plan is to port everything on Python 3.
